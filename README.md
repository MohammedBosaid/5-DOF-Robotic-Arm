# 5DOF Robotic Arm – 3D Design Based on Technical Sketch

This repository showcases a simplified conceptual design of a five-degree-of-freedom (5-DOF) robotic arm. The arm was initially visualized through a clean, technical pencil sketch, then modeled in 3D and exported in STL format for prototyping or presentation use.



## 📂 Repository Contents

- `sketch.png` – The original hand-drawn pencil sketch used as the visual reference.
- `render.png` – A static PNG render of the resulting 3D model.
- `robotic_arm_model.stl` – The exported 3D model of the robotic arm in STL format.
- `README.md` – This documentation file.



## ✍️ Project Overview

- **Degrees of Freedom**: 5 rotary joints
- **Design Elements**: Cylindrical links, revolute joints, two-pronged gripper, bolted base flange.
- **Modeling Approach**: The design was manually created in 3D using a visual sketch as the base reference, and exported using Autodesk Fusion 360.



## 📐 Usage & Scope

This model is ideal for:
- Concept presentation in academic or engineering settings.
- Demonstrating the mechanical layout of a simple industrial robotic arm.
- Early-stage prototyping or 3D printing (note: not dimensionally optimized for real-world use).

> ⚠️ Dimensions were not derived from a mechanical specification and should not be used for manufacturing without proper validation.
